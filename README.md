# prosv5-autoselect

Example PROS V5 project using  a potentiometer to select between various Autonomous routines.

Please Note: currently usign the competition_initialize() function to preselect via legay sensors does not work propperly.  Hence the function to get the state of the potentiometer is called directly at the start of the autonomous program.
